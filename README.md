## Install

```bash
npm install react-holiday-ui
```

## Examples
See examples at https://ericdudley.github.io/react-holiday-ui

## Usage

1. Important the holiday component you want to use.
2. Make sure to import the `react-holiday-ui/dist/index.css` file.

```tsx
import React, { Component } from 'react';

import { Christmas } from 'react-holiday-ui';
import 'react-holiday-ui/dist/index.css';

const ExampleComponent = () => {
  return <Christmas />;
};
```

## API
`react-holiday-ui` exports high-level components as well as the underlying view components. For example, you can use the `<Snowman />` or `<Snowflakes />` components individually, or you can use the `<Christmas />` component which renders them both. 

| Holiday | Components|
| --- | --- |
| Christmas| `Snowman`, `Snowflakes`, `Christmas` |

## Toggling

In order to allow users to toggle the holiday UI on and off, you can leverage the following options. 



> Note: **All** of the options below persist the toggle state to local storage, so if a user toggles the UI off and refreshes the page, it will still be toggled off.

### 1. Default `ToggleButton` component

The `ToggleButton` component is a default HTML button that can be styled via the `styles` or `className` props. It renders 'On' and 'Off' and will toggle the holiday UI.
> Note: This component can be used anywhere in your application and does **not** require any specific component hierarchy.
```tsx
import React, { Component } from 'react';

import { ToggleButton } from 'react-holiday-ui';
import 'react-holiday-ui/dist/index.css';

const ExampleComponent = () => {
  return <ToggleButton className="example-class" style={{ height: '24px' }} />
};
```

### 2. `useReactHolidayUI` hook

The `useReactHolidayUI` hook returns an object containing `isActive`, `toggleIsActive`, and `setIsActive` that can be used to build a custom toggle component that better fits into your existing UI.
> Note: This hook can be called from anywhere in your application and does **not** require any specific component hierarchy.
```tsx
import React, { Component } from 'react';

import { useReactHolidayUI } from 'react-holiday-ui';
import 'react-holiday-ui/dist/index.css';

const CustomToggle = () => {
  const { isActive, toggleIsActive } = useReactHolidayUI();
  return <div>
    <label htmlFor="react-holiday-ui-checkbox">Holiday UI</label>
    <input id="react-holiday-ui-checkbox" type="checkbox" checked={isActive} onChange={toggleIsActive} />
  </div >;
}
```
